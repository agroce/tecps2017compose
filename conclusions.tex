\section{Conclusions}

Cyber-physical systems are typically complex, and tend to combine reactive real-time behavioral requirements, communication across unreliable networks, a high degree of computational heterogeneity, and user interfaces that are unusually complex and brittle --- even when they lack the additional complexity of high-level autonomy.  Designing such systems is difficult using today's methods, and testing them is a particular challenge.  In this paper, we propose one thrust of the effort to make CPS more testable.  In particular, we propose two steps.  In the short run, adapting the cause reduction algorithm can enable composition of tests written for different layers of a CPS; in the long run architectural support for this approach should make it more powerful and widely applicable.
