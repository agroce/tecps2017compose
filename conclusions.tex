\section{Conclusions}

Cyber-physical systems are typically complex, and tend to combine reactive real-time behavioral requirements, communication across unreliable networks, a high degree of computational heterogeneity, and user interfaces that are unusually complex and brittle --- even when they lack the additional complexity of high-level autonomy.  Designing such systems is difficult using today's methods, and testing them is a particular challenge.  In this paper, we propose one thrust of the effort to make CPS more testable.  In particular, we propose two steps.  In the short run, we believe that adapting an existing test manipulation algorithm, cause reduction (a generalization of delta-debugging), can enable the composition of tests written for different layers of a CPS.
