\section{Related Work}

The idea of algorithms that operate on tests, as such, is
primarily represented in the literature by the work on
delta-debugging or test reduction in general:
\cite{DD,HDD,TCminim,MinUnit,CReduce,Lithium,ZellerBook,DDISSTA,IsolThread,Yesterday}.  Pike proposed a limited test
generalization that applies to tests that consist of Haskell data
values \cite{SmartCheck}; Sai proposed a very limited, ad hoc
version of semantic minimization that lacks the goal of normalization,
but shares the goal of simplifying tests beyond what is possible with
conventional delta-debugging \cite{SaiSimple}.  Work on automatically producing readable tests \cite{Guava,Readable} is also
related, in that it aims to ``simplify'' tests.  Test case
purification \cite{PureTest} is a kind of limited (in approach and in
goal) decomposition.  To our knowledge, there is no existing work on composing tests at heterogenous layers of of system, CPS or otherwise.
